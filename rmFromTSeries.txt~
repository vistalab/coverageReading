Notes on what we'd need if we wanted a function that inputs a time series 
of an ROI and returns the RM model

Function stack:

* view = rmMain(view, roiFileName, wSearch. varargin)
    - checks that the arguments exist
    - defines the parameters structure used in the rest of the program
    - makes the stimuli to convolve with the prf
    - check which fitting strategy you want to use

    * [view] = rmGridFit(view,params)
        - defines params.analysis -- which is itself a struct
        - makes the pRF predictions (lines 84 - 147)
            
            * [data, params] = rmLoadData(view, params, slice, params.analysis.coarseToFine)
                - loads the time series from the view
            * rmMakeTrends
                - make trends to fit with the model
             
        - removes the trends from time series
            
            * rmEstimateDC
                - resets the DC compoment 
            * rmDecimate
                - decimate data if requested
