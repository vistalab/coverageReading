INITIAL VERSION
1. For each subject, modify appropriate values in <<make_Sparams.m>> and then run this script.
    This should save a mat file called <<Sparams.mat>> which includes the names of the ret models and the roi files

2. Edit the script call_makeS_allSubs (include the subjects who have pre-processed data).
    Run this script.
    This should save <<S.mat>> and <<Sth.mat>> in the current directory
    
3. Running the first cell of <<pipelineStats.m>> will create structs SS and SSth that are concatenated SSs from all subjects
